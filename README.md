## Redux State Management

Redux is a state management library used in the ShopyShop Redux Version application to manage global state, ensuring a consistent and predictable data flow throughout the application. Redux Toolkit is utilized to simplify and streamline the Redux setup.

### Reducers and Actions

#### `cartReducer.js`

- **addItem**: An asynchronous thunk responsible for adding a product to the user's cart. It checks if the product is already in the cart and handles the addition accordingly.

- **fetchCartProducts**: An asynchronous thunk for fetching cart products in real-time. It listens for changes to the cart collection and updates the cart items in the state.

- **removeFromCart**: An asynchronous thunk to remove a particular product from the cart.

- **increaseQuantity**: An asynchronous thunk to increase the quantity of a specific product in the cart.

- **decreaseQuantity**: An asynchronous thunk to decrease the quantity of a product in the cart or remove it if the quantity reaches zero.

- **purchase**: An asynchronous thunk to purchase all items in the cart. It removes items from the cart one by one and adds them to the MyOrders collection.

#### `productReducer.js`

- **fetchProductsAndStore**: An asynchronous thunk responsible for fetching from `https://fakestoreapi.com/products` and storing products in DataBase . It checks the last fetch timestamp to determine if data should be fetched from an external API or Firebase.

#### `userReducer.js`

- **signIn**: An asynchronous thunk to handle user sign-in. It signs in the user using email and password, updates the userUID in the Redux store, and stores it in local storage.

- **logOut**: An asynchronous thunk to handle user log-out. It logs the user out, clears the userUID from the state, and removes it from local storage.

### Redux State Structure

The Redux state is divided into multiple parts:

- **Cart State**: Managed by `cartReducer.js`, including cart items, loading state, and error handling.

- **Product State**: Managed by `productReducer.js`, which holds the list of products, loading state, and error handling.

- **User State**: Managed by `userReducer.js`, storing the user's unique identifier (UID).


### Firebase Integration

Firestore from Firebase is used for data storage and Firebase Authentication is used for user sign-in and log-out.

With Redux and Firebase, ShopyShop Redux Version ensures efficient state management and data handling, providing a seamless shopping experience for users.
